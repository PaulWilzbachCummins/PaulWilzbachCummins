Hi, Iâ€™m @PaulWilzbachCummins.

Professionally, I am interested in applying data science and GIS in the areas of:
  1. Ecological Conservation / Ecosystem Restoration
  2. Natural Resource Management
  3. Sustainable Agriculture

As a hobby, I also enjoy exploring the intersection of music, math, and computer/data science.
